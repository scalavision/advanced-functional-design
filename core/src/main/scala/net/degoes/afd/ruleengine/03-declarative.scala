/**
 * Executable encodings are free of boilerplate and fast and flexible. However,
 * they tend to be less powerful and principled than declarative encodings,
 * which can be used with infinitely many different interpreters, each doing
 * something different (and useful!) with the model.
 *
 * In this section, you will refactor the rule engine you created to use the
 * declarative encoding. In the process, you will discover _expressions_, which
 * are recipes to describe the production of values from other values.
 *
 * To push this model to its logical conclusion, it will be necessary to
 * eliminate all Scala functions, which raises questions about how well-typed
 * you want to make the model.

/**
 * Develop a fully declarative encoding of a rule engine. You are NOT allowed to
 * use any Scala functions in your model. Rather, your model must be purely
 * ADT-based. Attempt to make your model as type-safe as possible, but sacrifice
 * type-safety if necessary in order to avoid the embedding of Scala functions
 * in your model.
 *
 * You must develop an executor for the model which, given input and the rule
 * set, produces actions as output.
